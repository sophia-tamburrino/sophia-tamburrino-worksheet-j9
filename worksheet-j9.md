## #1 - What is the difference between a design pattern and a java library?
A design pattern contains techniques and templates on how to program something. A Java library you can import and use the methods to assist in making a program, but a design pattern is a concept.
## #2 - Using the Singleton pattern, write code/pseudocode that ensures that only one database connection object is ever instantiated.
```Java

```
## #3 - Using the Factory pattern, write code/pseudocode that sets up a factory for two child classes of Animal: Bird and Mammal. Each of these has a constructor with the same arguments as those of the parent class.
```Java

```
